    <title> Halloween Traditions with Friends </title>
</head>

<body>
    <p> My favorite annual tradition has been traveling to New Orleans and dressing up for Halloween 
        in group costumes with my friends. Every year for the past four years, my best friends, 
        Erin, Kendra, and Shannon, and I have made our way to the Big Easy to reconnect, to celebrate, 
        and to enjoy life in one of the most fun cities that I have ever been to. </p>

    <h1><b>The Beginning of a New Tradition</b></h1>
        <p> How did this tradition begin you ask? As young women growing up in St. Louis, 
            we were tired of constantly being let down by Halloween celebrations in St. Louis. 
            We decided to travel somewhere and whatever location we chose, we would do a group costume. 
            We googled best Halloween celebrations in the nation and New Orleans popped right up! 
            After doing research, New Orleans for Halloween made a lot of sense. Ghost culture, Voodoo, 
            the many haunted locations, haunted tours, not to mention the food, drinks, and the street parties. 
            We were sold on the idea; New Orleans for Halloween was the place for us.  </p>

            As a whole, we knew that we wanted to do an epic group costume. Kendra suggested the 
            simplest costume for our foursome to dress up as, would be the rock band KISS. 
            Literally, all we would need would be leather, maybe some boots and face paint. </article>
        </p>

<h2> <b>The Turnup</b></h2>
        <p>We made our way to New Orleans and got ready for a night of fun. As we got dressed in our
            leather and makeup, we began to feel like KISS. We even made up a song and dance 
            routine to the KISS song, <em>I Wanna Rock and Roll All Night</em>.</p>

        <p> We made our way to Bourbon Street in the French Quarter to party. We were surrounded by 
            fellow partygoers, as we barhopped our way down the crowded street. We were stopped 
            so people could take pictures of us, we constantly did our routine, and even entered a costume 
            contest. Halloween in New Orleans lived up to our expectations. We definitely were <b>RockStars</b> 
            that night. </p>

<h3>The Aftermath</h3>
        <p>After that first epic night in 2014, Erin, Kendra, Shannon, and I decided to make Halloween
           in New Orleans our tradition. Even though life has pulled us in different directions, Erin lives
           in New Orleans, Kendra is in Los Angeles, Shannon is in Chicago, and I am in St. Louis, we meet in 
           New Orleans every Halloween to reconnect as we dress up in group costumes and party. Even though we 
           have gone from young women to slightly older women, I hope that our tradition never ends and our fun 
           and friendship continues.

        <p> I imagine us continuing this tradition forever and dressing up in our old age. Hopefully, enjoying 
            and celebrating life, as well as maintaining our connection as friends never has an age limit. </p>
